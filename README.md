<h2> Simple shape detector</h2>

- In order to train and test the Tensorflow model, please install
  - Tensorflow
  - Numpy
  
  
- The default model architecture contains 3 hidden layers, and uses softmax in output layer.
  The structure should be enough to differentiate between primitive shapes such as circles, triangels, squares and stars.
