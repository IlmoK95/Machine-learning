<h2> Simple shape detector</h2>

- In oreder to train and test the Tensorflow model, pleasde install
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Numpy
  
  
- The default model architecture contains 3 hidden layers, and uses softmax in output layer.
  The structure should be enough to differentiate between primitive shapes such as circles, triangels, aquares and stars.
